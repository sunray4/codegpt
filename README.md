## What it does ‚öôÔ∏è

When you submit a GitHub repository link or a code snippet to CodeGPT, it can to generate a line-by-line summary of the repo in plain text. This allows developers to quickly understand the project and start contributing.

When a GitHub repository link is submitted, our app uses the GitHub API to walk through all files within the repository and retrieve the code in each file. Using a fine-tuned CodeT5 code-to-text model from Hugging Face, all code within the repository can be summarized. The original code and its corresponding summarization are displayed side-by-side, allowing developers to understand the code segments easily. If the user creates an account on our application, it also stores all past searches to allow easy future access.

## How we built it üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüîß

We built our web application using Python with Flask framework, HTML, Tailwind CSS, MongoDB Atlas for the database and downloaded a CodeT5-base model for code summarization.
